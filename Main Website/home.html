            </h3>
            <p>
              I am a junior at the University of Washington studying Applied Computational
              Math Science (ACMS) with a focus in data science and numerical algorithms. While
              studying, I am apart of many other organizations including Purple Caster Minions,
              where I facilitate different events for our members, the Vietnamese Eucharistic
              Youth Movement, where I teach about Catholic teachings to students ranging from ages
              thirteen to eighteen, and Phi Chi Theta, where I coordinate fundraising campaigns.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from that, I also work at the University of Washington's college of education as
              an IT support user, conduct research with UW's college of business, and teach code at
              UW's Husky Union Building.
            </p>
            <p>
              With everything going on though, I still make some time out to read, work on
              development projects, and learn on my own. Every day, there's always something new to
              learn and a new challenge in front of yourself, and I always aim to push through that
              challenge to face another greater one. Challenge after challenge, you eventually
              reach a point where you never imagined you could be, and I want to continue exploring
              that through the end of my college experience and onward.

            <h3>"Leadership and learning are indispensable to each other. - John F. Kennedy"</h3>
            <p>
              Starting June of 2019, that would be the first time I would classify myself as the
              student I am today. A student, who does not only learn to reach an end goal, but
              instead continues to look onward without limitation to discover more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through learning to only discover more, there's a transitional point that happened as
              school work didn't seem like work, but it was more of a way to continue discovering
              yourself and who wouldn't want that haha. Not to mention, the possibilities started to
              become endless of what learning could lead you to do next.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the future, I hope to use all of the knowledge I accumulate today to start a
              business in the medical industry. Through growing up, I was always advised to become
              a doctor, unsure if whether it was because of the money or the chance to help others.
              What sticked with me the most though was the latter. I continued to ask myself how I
              can help others every single day, and although I can't help through medical synopsis,
              I hope to empower those who can and provide more tools for people to acquire
              healthcare.

            <p>
              Within university, there are countless number of pathways you can choose. "Maybe I'll
              take organic chemistry or economics," I thought to myself, but for some reason, I was
              always against taking a computer science class. I never looked into computer science,
              but I always had this stigma of just sitting at a desk to do work, and I loathed it
              because how could I make an impact on others that way?
            </p>
            <p>
              This same thought persisted up until November of 2017, where someone challenged my
              mindset as I was signing up for classes. "Just try it out and see how the class goes.
              You will never know what it is like until you try," he said. After careful
              consideration, I then took the leap of faith and took the computer science class.
              Soon enough, my eyes were opened up to a new world of possibilities about our vast
              society today, and I could not stop learning more about the capabilities of computer
              science.
            </p>
            <p>
              A few years passed from learning my first print statement in java, and since then I
              have assisted many research projects, developed vast programs, and built data insight
              for companies. While signing up for those classes, I never thought I would be making
              these discoveries and be where I am at today, but the future can surprise you in
              countless ways. The journey is still young, and as I continue to journey through
              self-learning more about the different capabilities of computer science, I hope to
              continue pushing the limits of this industry.

            <p>
              In August of 2019, I was unsure of where life would take me. I had no idea of if
              everything I learned through life was for naught as I made a mistake that not
              only affected myself drastically, but vastly hurt those around me. Unsure of
              where to venture, I sat down with my family and seeked advice as I told them the
              occurrence. "You need to learn how to control your emotions. You've always had this
              problem for a long time and its now getting out of hand. How are you going to fix
              this?" a family member voiced. With my head slightly tilted down, I stated, "I will
              learn. I need to learn this, and I won't just say it, but I will tackle it myself."
            </p>
            <!--<p>
              A few days of reflection passed, and I asked my sister about a book she had on her
              desk called, "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck." She lent it to me, and within a
              few day, I had finished reading the entire book. The contents discuss the methodology
              of how we focus on other people’s opinions and consider aspects of how  Before this
              time, I never thought I would pick up a book aside for classes, but low and behold,
              I went on after reading that book to continue discovering more books to not only hone
              my emotions, but to discover more about life.

                After doing a good amount of projects, I looked into different areas of computer science,
                including web development. After learning it for a few weeks, I am now proud to share out
                this portfolio!

          <h3>AWS Solutions Architect </h3>
          <p>
            After learning about Amazon web services through the AWS CPP examination, the cloud
            continues to intrigue me more and more. The vastness of Amazon web services is breathtaking,
            and to continue learning more about the cloud, I am preparing to take the AWS Solutions Architect
            Associate examination.

          <h3>Python Course</h3>
          <p>
            Following my discord workshop, the sense of teaching others opened up a new challenge.
            Many have told me, the best way to know if you have mastered something is if you can
            teach it, and with coding, there is no exception. Therefore, I am currently hosting
            a Python course through HUB Games where I build the foundations of how to work with
            Riot Games' API.

          <h3>Dynamic Websites</h3>
          <p>
            After programming this website and learning more about web development, I am continuing
            to learn more about different tools to host websites such as Node.js, MySQL, PHP, and
            Spark. Through self-learning the University of Washington's CSE154 course content, I
            hope to improve this site even more as I look to incorporate it with those tools in
            addition to AWS.
