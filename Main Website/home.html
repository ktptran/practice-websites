            <h3>"The man that embodies rise and grind" - Daniel Pham</h3>
            <p>
              I am a 21 year old junior at the University of Washington who has been diving head
              first into the computer and data science field for the past two years.
            </p>
            <p>
              My passion is all about continuing to learn something new every day to both challenge
              myself and to thank those who have shaped me into who I am today. Always
              learning has led me to not only explore new things, but to invoke new
              identities within myself as an ongoing student, developer, and a reader.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also am an avid leader who always pushes the threshold of any new situation. From
              the words of one of my colleagues, I am "the first to notice areas that need
              improvement and take initiative to spearhead those changes," and I hope to continue
              doing this with every new opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently looking for opportunities to connect with others to talk about industry,
              literature, and learning new perspectives. Feel free to reach out to me through
              any of the platforms, and I look forward to what comes next in our conversations.
            </p>

            <h2>Always Learning</h2>
            <h3>
              “Every morning, the sun rises with endless possibilities that give you endless
              opportunities to begin again and to create a brand-new life.” - Debasisha Mridha
            </h3>
            <p>
              Going through college, I jumped around many different fields including chemistry,
              business, engineering, and proof-based mathematics. All of them had something unique,
              but I never felt the urge to keep learning more outside of classwork. This was the case
              up until early 2019 where I stumbled on online videos and began self-learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              This would be the first time I would consider myself a student as I am hunting to learn
              more instead of being gifted it. The start of doing this was always the hardest part,
              but after continually pushing myself this past year, the rewards continue to push me
              to search more.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I enter into my final undergraduate year, I aim to continue self-learning to build
              the foundation of always learning after graduating with a bachelors of science in applied
              math.
            </p>

            <h2>Coding Opens Doors</h2>
            <h3>
              "Give a man a program, frustrate him for a day. Teach a man to program,
              frustrate him for a lifetime." - Muhammad Waseem
            </h3>
            <p>
              Learning computer science and programming the past two years have continually opened
              my eyes to how amazing this world is. Using the programs themselves are amazing, but
              as you delve deeper into the field you experience how computers talk throughout the globe,
              how information is processed, and more!
            </p>
            <p>
              As a developer now, I am continually challenging myself to learn these new concepts
              and translate them to new projects. Not only will it build my knowledge, but I hope
              to translate these fundamentals to build a startup. As a developer, I aim to not only
              build the program to make it, but to have a vision of changing the world with every
              functionality created.

            <h2>What Books Bestow</h2>
            <h3>
              “A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies . . . The man who never reads lives
              only one.” – George R.R. Martin
            </h3>
            <p>
              A few years ago, I traveled to different states alone to learn more about myself and
              the world. Those moments were very enriching to learn how to survive and experience
              new adventures, but there was something missing. I never determined what until I
              started reading my first book in August of 2019 called "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck".
            </p>
            <p>
              The book was highly informative about life struggles and opened a new vantage point of
              approaching life. Unlike traveling, you are not able to see amazing vantage points,
              but you are able to experience life through the eyes of someone else and read about
              their methodology to enrich your own.
            </p>
            <p>
              From that point on, I have read around twenty books focused on concepts like self
              help, medical stances, and more! I hope to share these books out eventually in a blog
              in the coming future, but for now, here is the list of books, I have read and would
              recommend as I hope it enriches your life just as it did my own.

            Hall Health is the University of Washington's medical clinic to aid University students
            throughout the year. This was my first development project where I worked with both a
            team and an organization, and it was an amazing experience to witness how our knowledge
            is impacting the world today. During this project, I was the main facilitator for the
            project tasks and direction.

            where I was able to challenge my coding skills while developing insight to real world
            problems. With my team, I analyzed the location of crime and the
            distribution of times throughout the days, months, and years available.

              <p>
                Starting February of 2020, I studied the fundamentals of
                <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> to
                understand the capabilities of the cloud and how it is used today.

                After finishing many data projects, I explored different areas of computer science,
                including web development. After learning front-end development for a few weeks,
                I am proud to share this portfolio!

          <h3>AWS Solutions Architect </h3>
          <p>
            After learning about the fundamentals of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud continues
            to intrigue me due to its vast capabilities. The nature of it is simply breathtaking.
            I am now preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect Associates certification to explore
            the cloud even more to eventually master it in the coming years.

          <h3>Python Course</h3>
          <p>
            Following my discord workshop, the teaching experience opened up a new set of
            challenges to me. Not only did I need to understand the material, but I needed to
            present the content in a way where students could learn proficiently and
            enthusiastically. Therefore, I am now hosting a 7-week Python course focused on
            working with Riot Games' API to face these challenges head on.

          <h3>Dynamic Website Development</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently working with a team of 10 to build a dynamic website for an organization.
            Within this project, I am the technical lead where I will guide the development process
            similar to a scrum master. Even though this is a daunting task for a student developer,
            I am very excited to pursue this project
            with an estimated release of early August.
